# Python_Basics
This repository contains a collection of Python exercises and projects that cover basic Python concepts and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) practice.
It is divided into two main sections:
1. Python Basics
2. OOP practice

## Python Basics
This section covers fundamental Python programming concepts and contains two subfolders:
### Basic Python Projects
This folder contains simple Python projects designed to help you understand basic programming concepts such as:
+ Variables and data types
+ Control flow (if-else, loops)
+ Functions and modules

### Data Structures and Algorithms Exercises
These are exercises from the book "Data Structures and Algorithms in Python", focused on fundamental algorithms and data structures. Topics include:
+ Lists, Stacks, Queues
+ Searching and Sorting algorithms
+ Trees, Graphs, and Hash tables

## OOP practice
This section is dedicated to practicing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. You will find exercises that involve creating and defining classes, objects, and methods. These exercises focus on:
+ Defining simple objects
+ Implementing inheritance and polymorphism
+ Encapsulation and abstraction
